      </div>
      <div className="font-medium">Dispute resolution</div>
      <div>
        YOU AND TEAM11 AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS: MANDATORY
        ARBITRATION. You and Team11 agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or our
        Services, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed (a “Dispute”), through
        final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation or of any
        updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by filling out this
        form(opens in a new window). If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed upon arbitration terms will
        apply. Informal dispute resolution. We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal
        legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute
        informally. You agree to do so by sending us notice through this form(opens in a new window). We will do so by
        sending you notice to the email address associated with your account. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute
        within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an individual
        settlement conference if either party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled
        during this informal resolution process. Arbitration forum. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of
        us may commence arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute
        Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available
        here(opens in a new window)). Team11 will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the
        arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The activities described in these Terms involve interstate
        commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration
        terms and any arbitration. Arbitration procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by video conference if
        possible, but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person, the location will be
        mutually agreed upon, in the county where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the batch
        arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be
        either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California. The arbitrator will
        have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California
        have the authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or
        requests for public injunctive relief, as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to
        the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has
        the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. Exceptions. This section does not
        require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in
        small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the
        Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. CLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. You and Team11
        agree that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class
        member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions,
        and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and
        litigate in court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim
        and all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You and
        Team11 knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.
        Batch arbitration. If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for
        arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then you and Team11 agree that
        NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (“Batch”), unless there are less than 50
        claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM will administer each Batch as a
        single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by
        videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found
        to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in
        individual proceedings. Severability. If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or
        unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute
        resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.
      </div>
      <div className="font-medium">General Terms</div>
      <div>
        Assignment. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and any attempt to do so
        will be void. We may assign our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate, subsidiary, or
        successor in interest of any business associated with our Services. Changes to these Terms or our Services. We
        are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We may update these Terms or our Services
        accordingly from time to time. For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due to:
      </div>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
        <li>Changes to the law or regulatory requirements.</li>
        <li>Security or safety reasons.</li>
        <li>Circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</li>
        <li>Changes we make in the usual course of developing our Services.</li>
        <li>To adapt to new technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      <div>
        We will give you at least 30 days advance notice of changes to these Terms that materially adversely impact you
        either via email or an in-product notification. All other changes will be effective as soon as we post them to
        our website. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using our Services. Delay in enforcing these
        Terms. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later. Except as provided in the
        dispute resolution section above, if any portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
        that portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any
        other terms. Trade controls. You must comply with all applicable trade laws, including sanctions and export
        control laws. Our Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, or exported or re-exported to (a) any U.S.
        embargoed country or territory or (b) any individual or entity with whom dealings are prohibited or restricted
        under applicable trade laws. Our Services may not be used for any end use prohibited by applicable trade laws,
        and your Input may not include material or information that requires a government license for release or export.
        Entire agreement. These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and Team11 regarding the Services and,
        other than any Service-specific terms, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and
        Team11. Governing law. California law will govern these Terms except for its conflicts of laws principles.
        Except as provided in the dispute resolution section above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms
        will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco, California.
